Different technologies and paradigms are hyperconnected and offer advances to society. The usage of other technologies among these devices makes security uneven. When facing a pentest in any environment, one major factor is the network. The network interconnects the world of the Internet of Things, the world of industrial control systems, and information technology. This README introduces the 'on-the-fly' tool, which gives capabilities to perform pentesting tests in several domains (IoT, ICS & IT). It is an innovative tool by bringing together different worlds sharing a common factor: the network. 

# Prerequisities
'on-the-fly' was written in Python and made extensive use of Scapy and netfilterqueue. It is crucial to have Scapy in Python and netfilterqueue installed with a compatible version of Python. For this, a version of Python 3 up to Python version 3.7.5 is recommended (and no higher, as there may be incompatibilities with 3.8 and 3.9 in some libraries that it uses 'on-the-fly'). 
There is a requirements.txt file that must be executed the first time the tool is launched using 'pip install -r requirements.txt'. Again the pip version must be oriented to a Python 3 version up to 3.7.5.
```[python]
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Usage

```[python]
python on-the-fly.py
```
